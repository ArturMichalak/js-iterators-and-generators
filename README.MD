# ITERATORS AND GENERATORS

Usage of functionalities added to browsers between 2013 and 2015.

## Short description ([MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Iterators_and_generators))

Iterators and Generators bring the concept of iteration directly into the core language and provide a mechanism for customizing the behavior of for...of loops.

### Iterators

An iterator is an object which defines a sequence and potentially a return value upon its termination.

### Generator functions

Generator functions allow you to define an iterative algorithm by writing a single function whose execution is not continuous.

### dependencies installation ([documentation](https://yarnpkg.com/cli/install)):

    yarn install -D

### build production package:

    yarn build

We also have yield\*, but that requires a different example.
